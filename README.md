🔴⚫ Python Checkers with AI ⚫🔴

Welcome to a classic game of Checkers, brought to life with Python and Pygame! This project is not just a simple board game; it's a fully functional application featuring a challenging AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm. Test your strategic skills against a computer that thinks moves ahead!

Note: This project was developed as a comprehensive exercise in game logic, object-oriented programming, and fundamental AI implementation.

🚀 Features

Classic Checkers Gameplay: All standard rules are implemented, including forced captures.

Intelligent AI Opponent: Play against an unbeatable AI that uses the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to calculate the optimal move.

Interactive GUI: A clean and responsive graphical interface built entirely with the Pygame library.

Valid Move Highlighting: When you select a piece, all possible legal moves are highlighted, making the game intuitive and user-friendly.

King Promotion: Reach the opponent's side of the board to have your pieces crowned as Kings with the ability to move backward.

Clear Winner Detection: The game automatically detects and announces the winner when a player has no more pieces or no more legal moves.
